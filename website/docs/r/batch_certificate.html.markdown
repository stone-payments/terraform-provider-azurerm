  location = "westeurope"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "test" {
  name                     = "teststorage"
  resource_group_name      = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  location                 = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_batch_account" "test" {
  name                 = "testbatchaccount"
  resource_group_name  = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  location             = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  pool_allocation_mode = "BatchService"
  storage_account_id   = "${azurerm_storage_account.test.id}"

  tags = {
    env = "test"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_batch_certificate" "test" {
  resource_group_name  = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  account_name         = "${azurerm_batch_account.test.name}"
  certificate          = "${filebase64("certificate.pfx")}"
  format               = "Pfx"
  password             = "terraform"
  thumbprint           = "42C107874FD0E4A9583292A2F1098E8FE4B2EDDA"
  thumbprint_algorithm = "SHA1"
}
