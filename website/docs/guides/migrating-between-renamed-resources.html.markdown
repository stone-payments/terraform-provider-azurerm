# Azure Provider: Migrating to a renamed resource

In v1.22 of the AzureRM Provider several resources have been deprecated in favour of a renamed version - this guide covers how to migrate from the old resource to the new one and is applicable for the following resources:

| Old Name                                       | New Name                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| azurerm_log_analytics_workspace_linked_service | azurerm_log_analytics_linked_service |
| azurerm_autoscale_setting                      | azurerm_monitor_autoscale_setting    |
| azurerm_metric_alertrule                       | azurerm_monitor_metric_alertrule     |
| azurerm_connection_monitor                     | azurerm_network_connection_monitor   |
| azurerm_ddos_protection_plan                   | azurerm_network_ddos_protection_plan |
| azurerm_packet_capture                         | azurerm_network_packet_capture       |

As the Schema's for each resource are the same at this time - it's possible to migrate between the resources by updating your Terraform Configuration and updating the Statefile.

In this guide we'll assume we're migrating from the `azurerm_autoscale_setting` resource to the new `azurerm_monitor_autoscale_setting` resource, but this should be applicable for any of the resources listed above.

Assuming we have the following Terraform Configuration:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "test" {
  # ...
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set" "test" {
  # ...
}

resource "azurerm_autoscale_setting" "test" {
  name                = "myAutoscaleSetting"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  target_resource_id  = "${azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set.test.id}"

  # ...
}
```

We can update the Terraform Configuration to use the new resource by updating the name from `azurerm_autoscale_setting` to `azurerm_monitor_autoscale_setting`:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "test" {
  # ...
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set" "test" {
  # ...
}

resource "azurerm_monitor_autoscale_setting" "test" {
  name                = "myAutoscaleSetting"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  target_resource_id  = "${azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set.test.id}"

  # ...
}
```

As the Terraform Configuration has been updated - we now need to update the State. We can view the items Terraform is tracking in it's Statefile using the `terraform state list` command, for example:

```bash
$ terraform state list
azurerm_autoscale_setting.test
azurerm_resource_group.test
azurerm_virtual_machine.test
```

We can move each of the resources which has been renamed in the state using the `terraform state mv` command - for example:

```shell
$ terraform state mv azurerm_autoscale_setting.test azurerm_monitor_autoscale_setting.test
Moved azurerm_autoscale_setting.test to azurerm_monitor_autoscale_setting.test
```

Once this has been done, running `terraform plan` should show no changes:

```shell
$ terraform plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

This means that Terraform did not detect any differences between your
configuration and real physical resources that exist. As a result, no
actions need to be performed.
```

At this point you've switched over to using the newly renamed resources and should be able to continue using Terraform as normal.
